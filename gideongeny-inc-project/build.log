Dependency 'androidx.
activity:activity-ktx
:1.11.0' requires 
libraries and 
applications that
           depend on 
it to compile 
against version 36 
or later of the
           Android 
APIs.
     
           :app is 
currently compiled 
against android-35.
     
           Also, the 
maximum recommended 
compile SDK version 
for Android Gradle
           plugin 
8.7.3 is 35.
     
           
Recommended action: 
Update this 
project's version of 
the Android Gradle
           plugin to 
one that supports 
36, then update this 
project to use
           
compileSdk of at 
least 36.
     
           Note that 
updating a library 
or application's 
compileSdk (which
           allows 
newer APIs to be 
used) can be done 
separately from 
updating
           targetSdk 
(which opts the app 
in to new runtime 
behavior) and
           minSdk 
(which determines 
which devices the
